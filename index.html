An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 hit Ecuador and affected thousands of civilians. About 272 people perished and 2,527 people were injured. It is upseting to see that tons of lives had been affected by this natrual disaster. Due to this earthquake lots of people are currently living without homes and live in deep poverty.
