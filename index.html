    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p2>I identify myself as latina. My family is from Ecuador and come here to the United States. Currently what had happened in Ecuador was devastating. An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 hit Ecuador and affected thousands of civilians. About 272 people perished and 2,527 people were injured. It is upseting to see that tons of lives had been affected by this natrual disaster. Due to this earthquake lots of people are currently living without homes and live in deep poverty. Luckly, countries like the United States are assisting Ecuador during their time of need. â‰¥</p2>
