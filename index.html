    <p>Hey guys! My name is Brigitte. I am a female latina highschool student and this website basically will inform you guys of the crisis that is happening in Ecuador.</p>
    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>I identify myself as latina. My family is from Ecuador and came here to the United States. Currently what had happened in Ecuador was devastating. An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 hit Ecuador and affected thousands of civilians. About 272 people perished and 2,527 people were injured. It is upseting to see that tons of lives had been affected by this natrual disaster. Due to this earthquake lots of people are currently living without homes and live in deep poverty. Luckly, countries like the United States are assisting Ecuador during their time of need. </p>
